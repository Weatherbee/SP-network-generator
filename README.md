# SP-network-generator
C++ software that randomly generates ANSI C code for a substitution-permutation network (SP-network).  Associated shell script that runs multiple iterations of this C++ software and finds which random SP-network is optimal for producing a maximal length sequence for use as a fast linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) substitute or for other scrambling applications.  The generated ANSI C code functions can be compiled for CPU execution or will synthesize without changes via Vivado HLS for efficient FPGA implementation.  The SP-network is constructed out of arbitrary non-uniform width S-boxes up to a settable maximum width.  Both the SP-network and its inverse are generated.

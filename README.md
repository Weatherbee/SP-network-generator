# SP-network-generator
C++ software that parametrically generates random ANSI C code for a given width substitution-permutation network (SP-network).  Associated shell script that runs multiple iterations of this C++ software and optimizes for maximal length SP-network sequences.  This facilitates the resulting optimized ANSI C functions to be use as a fast linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) substitute or for other data scrambling applications.  The generated ANSI C code functions can be compiled for CPU execution or will synthesize without changes via high-level synthesis for efficient FPGA or ASIC implementation.  The SP-network is constructed out of arbitrary non-uniform width S-boxes up to a settable maximum width.  Both the SP-network and its inverse are generated.

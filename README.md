# SP-network-generator
C++ software that randomly generates C code for substitution-permutation networks.  Associated shell script that runs multiple iterations and finds which random S-P network has a maximal length sequence for use as a fast LFSR substitute.  Code can be compiled with a C compiler or will synthesize via HLS for FPGA implementation.
